# Garage
personal garage where I tinker about my previous project.

I am Alif Iskandar, an Information Technology fresh graduates majoring in Artificial Intelligence. This repo will be a dusty store room for all my previous project that I had worked on before and also as a profile for me so why not...

Down here is the list of projects done :

### Artificial Intelligence Project
  * Image classification using machine learning model: VGG16
  * Smart room system using Raspberry Pi 4 with Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) implementation using Node-RED and geolocation
